# Pong Game with Q-Learning

This project implements a simple Pong Game using Pygame library, with an added twist of reinforcement learning (Q-learning) for controlling the paddles. The paddles are controlled by Q-learning agents that learn to play the game based on the current state and rewards.

## Q-Learning

The game features Q-learning agents for both paddles, allowing them to learn optimal strategies through reinforcement learning. Q-values are updated based on rewards and the next state, contributing to improved gameplay over time.
