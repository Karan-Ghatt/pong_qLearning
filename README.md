# Pong Game with Q-Learning

![Pong Game](path/to/your/game/screenshot.png)

This project implements a simple Pong Game using Pygame library, with an added twist of reinforcement learning (Q-learning) for controlling the paddles. The paddles are controlled by Q-learning agents that learn to play the game based on the current state and rewards.
